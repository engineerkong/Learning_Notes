# Examtopics


- A. Geo-redundant storage meets all the specified requirements. With geo-redundant storage, data is stored on multiple nodes located in separate geographic locations. It provides redundancy across regions, ensuring high availability and data durability. In addition, data can be read from both the primary and secondary locations, allowing for access to the data even if one location becomes unavailable.

B. Read-only geo-redundant storage does not fulfill the requirement that data can be written to and read from both the primary and secondary locations.

C. Zone-redundant storage is designed for redundancy within a single Azure region, and it does not satisfy the requirement for geographic separation.

D. Locally redundant storage does not meet the requirement of storing data on nodes in separate geographic locations.

- Azure Prodirect only for Professional Direct

- 1. The web apps will use custom domains. (Basic, Shared and standard Support custom domain)
2. The web apps each require 10 GB of storage. (basic and standard support this)
3. The web apps must each run in dedicated compute instances.(basic support 3 instance max where standard support 10max)
4. Load balancing between instances must be included. (free, shared and basic dont support load balancing. standard and above tier only support load balancing/autosacling)

- storage 12 GB
Free = 1 GB
Shared = 1 GB
Basic = 10 GB
Standard = 50 GB
Premium = 250 GB
Isolated = 1 TB

- The basic advantage of cloud computing is shifting your high Capital Expenditure (CAPEX) requirements to optimal Pay -As-You-Go model which is Operational Expenditure (OPEX)

- Azure API Management Service i( APIM ) is a way to create and manage customer APIs for existing backend services. The Question is asking about a way to create Azure resources automatically ( on the fly ). ARM (Azure Resource Manager) is a tool that automates the deployments on the AZ cloud.

- Management groups are only containers.

- 1. For all Virtual Machines that have two or more instances deployed across two or more Availability Zones in the same Azure region, we guarantee you will have Virtual Machine Connectivity to at least one instance at least 99.99% of the time.
2. For all Virtual Machines that have two or more instances deployed in the same Availability Set or in the same Dedicated Host Group, we guarantee you will have Virtual Machine Connectivity to at least one instance at least 99.95% of the time.
3. For any Single Instance Virtual Machine using Premium SSD or Ultra Disk for all Operating System Disks and Data Disks, we guarantee you will have Virtual Machine Connectivity of at least 99.9%.
4. For any Single Instance Virtual Machine using Standard SSD Managed Disks for Operating System Disk and Data Disks, we guarantee you will have Virtual Machine Connectivity of at least 99.5%.
5. For any Single Instance Virtual Machine using Standard HDD Managed Disks for Operating System Disks and Data Disks, we guarantee you will have Virtual Machine Connectivity of at least 95%.

- Azure DevTest Labs is designed to manage the lifecycle of development and testing environments, providing automation for the creation and deletion of resources, including virtual machines. It allows for rapid provisioning and de-provisioning of VMs, which aligns well with the requirement of deploying a large number of custom virtual machines on a weekly basis and removing them within the same week. It also supports both Windows and Linux operating systems, covering the mix of OSes mentioned in the scenario.

- A Point-to-Site (P2S) VPN gateway connection lets you create a secure connection to your virtual network from an individual client computer.

- Azure Information Protection (AIP) is a cloud-based solution that enables organizations to discover, classify, and protect documents and emails by applying labels to content. Azure Key Vault is suitable.

- You can use an Azure network security group to filter network traffic to and from Azure resources in an Azure virtual network. A network security group contains security rules that allow or deny inbound network traffic to, or outbound network traffic from, several types of Azure resources. For each rule, you can specify source and destination, port, and protocol.

- A local network gateway represents the hardware or software VPN device in your local network. Use this with a connection to set up a site-to-site VPN connection between an Azure virtual network and your local network.

- Azure provides flexibility between CAPEX and OPEX

- An organization that hosts its infrastructure in a public cloud can close its data center.

- Azure App Service, Azure Storage accounts, Azure Backup, Azure files and Azure SQL Database are PaaS. Azure VM Service, legacy Database are IaaS. Microsoft Intune are SaaS.

- Hyper-V hosts are physical servers that run the Hyper-V role in Windows Server. Hyper-V is a hypervisor-based virtualization technology provided by Microsoft, allowing for the creation and management of virtual machines (VMs).

- The physical servers are owned and managed by Microsoft. As an Azure customer, you have no access to the physical servers.

- You can assign a policy to any scope that you have access to, such as a management group, subscription, or resource group. However, you cannot assign a policy directly to an individual resource. You can assign a lock on every Azure resource that you have access to. You can apply a lock at different levels of scope: subscription, resource group, or individual resource.

- ![0007700001](https://github.com/engineerkong/Learning_Notes/assets/89781823/6a776874-33f0-441e-8f93-aa9def296754)

- Autoscaling is an example of elasticity.

- Azure Files supports synchronization between on-premises storage and Azure Storage

- Local - means creating a resource in your DC. Virtual Network Gateways - VPN application

- a Virtual Machine Scale Set (VMSS) is a group of identical, load-balanced VMs.

- An Azure AD tenant can have multiple subscriptions but an Azure subscription can only be associated with one Azure AD tenant.

- Gateway Subnet and VNet Gateway - implement a solution that enables the client computers on your on-premises network to communicate to the Azure virtual machines.

- If you want to raise the limit or quota above the default limit, open an online customer support request at no charge.

- Azure containers are the backbone of the virtual disks platform for Azure IaaS.

- VPN（虚拟私人网络）和虚拟网络（Virtual Network）是两种在网络技术中常见的概念，它们在用途和实现方式上有所不同：

1. **VPN（虚拟私人网络）**:
   - **目的**：VPN的主要目的是通过公共网络（如互联网）安全地连接远程用户或不同地理位置的网络。它允许用户通过加密的通道安全地访问公司或组织的内部网络。
   - **加密和隐私**：VPN提供了端到端的加密保护，保证数据传输的安全性和隐私性。
   - **远程访问**：VPN通常用于远程工作，允许员工从任何地方安全地连接到企业网络。
   - **实现**：VPN通过在公共网络上创建“隧道”来工作，这些隧道通过加密技术保护数据传输过程中的安全。

2. **虚拟网络（Virtual Network）**:
   - **目的**：虚拟网络通常是在云计算环境中创建的，用于在一个隔离的环境中连接虚拟机和其他资源。它们是在云提供商的基础设施上构建的逻辑网络。
   - **网络隔离和控制**：虚拟网络提供了网络隔离和完全的网络控制，包括IP地址范围的选择、创建子网、配置路由表和网络网关。
   - **云资源连接**：虚拟网络主要用于云环境中，使得不同的云服务（如虚拟机、数据库服务等）可以安全地相互通信。
   - **实现**：虚拟网络是通过软件定义网络（SDN）技术实现的，允许用户配置私有的网络环境，而无需物理硬件。

总结来说，VPN主要用于通过加密的方式安全地连接远程用户到中心网络，而虚拟网络则用于在云环境中构建隔离的、可控制的网络环境。虽然两者都提供网络隔离和安全性，但它们的应用场景和实现技术有明显的差异。

- COSMOS DB for data from multiple regions

- Tags for Resources are not inherited by default from their Resource Group. Permissions set at the resource level are inherited by the resources in the resource group.

- Azure storage offers different access tiers: hot, cool and archive.

- Azure Event Hubs is a big data streaming platform and event ingestion service.

- LocallyRedundant Storage (LRS) is the default which maintains three copies of the data in the data center.
Geo-redundant storage (GRS) has cross-regional replication to protect against regional outages. Data is replicated synchronously three times in the primary region, then replicated asynchronously to the secondary region.

- IoT Sphere = Secure
Central = Monitor
Hub = not the other two, just telemetry ;)

- Azure AD to sign in a local computer, the computer also must be in the AD

- Only the hot and cool access tiers can be set at the account level. The archive access tier can only be set at the blob level.

- Azure Logic Apps is a cloud-based platform for creating and running automated workflows that integrate your apps, data, services, and systems.

- Policy: Restrict with virtual machine types can be created in a subscription
Tags: Identify Azure resources that are associated with specific cost centers
Blueprints: Deploy a complete Azure Application environment including resources configuration and role assignments.

- A Site-to-Site VPN gateway connection is used to connect your on-premises network to an Azure virtual network over an IPsec/IKE (IKEv1 or IKEv2) VPN tunnel.
