A cloud service that helps you schedule, automate, and orchestrate tasks, business processes, and workflows when you need to integrate apps, data, systems, and services across enterprises or organizations.

## Developer and Mobile Tools

(Azure SignalR Service, Azure App Service, Visual Studio, Xamarin)

- Azure App Service: control webapps on cloud

## DevOps Services

(Azure DevOps, Azure Boards, Azure Pipelines, Azure Repos, Azure Test Plans, Azure Artifacts, Azure DevTest Labs)

- Azure DevTest Labs: manage the lifecycle of development and testing environments, providing automation for the creation and deletion of resources, including virtual machines. It allows for rapid provisioning and de-provisioning of VMs, which aligns well with the requirement of deploying a large number of custom virtual machines on a weekly basis and removing them within the same week. It also supports both Windows and Linux operating systems, covering the mix of OSes mentioned in the scenario.

## Network Services:

- Azure Virtual Network: Isolated
- Azure VPN Gateway: VPN application
1. A Point-to-Site (P2S) VPN gateway connection lets you create a secure connection to your virtual network from an individual client computer.
2. A Site-to-Site VPN gateway connection is used to connect your on-premises network to an Azure virtual network over an IPsec/IKE (IKEv1 or IKEv2) VPN tunnel.
- Azure ExpressRoute: enables a private connection between an organization's on-premises infrastructure and Microsoft Azure datacenters. Operates at Layer 3, the Network Layer, of the OSI model.
- Network security groups: provide distributed network layer traffic filtering to limit traffic to resources within virtual networks in each subscription. A network security group contains security rules that allow or deny inbound network traffic to, or outbound network traffic from, several types of Azure resources. For each rule, you can specify source and destination, port, and protocol.
- Azure Firewall: a fully stateful, centralized network firewall as-a-service, which provides network- and application-level protection across different subscriptions and virtual networks.
- Azure Service Endpoints: secure and isolate access to Azure services to a virtual network.
- A local network gateway represents the hardware or software VPN device in your local network. Use this with a connection to set up a site-to-site VPN connection between an Azure virtual network and your local network.
- Gateway Subnet and VNet Gateway - implement a solution that enables the client computers on your on-premises network to communicate to the Azure virtual machines.
- VPN主要用于通过加密的方式安全地连接远程用户到中心网络，而虚拟网络则用于在云环境中构建隔离的、可控制的网络环境。
- A content delivery network (CDN) is a distributed network of servers that can efficiently deliver web content to users. CDNs store cached content on edge servers in point-of-presence (POP) locations that are close to end users, to minimize latency.
- Traffic Manager is used to distribute traffic at DNS level across different regions.

## Management Services:


- Azure API Management Service ( APIM ) is a way to create and manage customer APIs for existing backend services.
- Azure Resources Management (ARM): automates the deployments on the AZ cloud.
- Management groups: containers
- Azure Advisor: does not provide recommendations on how to improve the security of an Azure AD environment. Can generate a list of VM's "NOT" protected by backup. Azure Advisor provides recommendations on high availability, security, performance and cost.
- Azure Active Directory: An Azure AD tenant can have multiple subscriptions but an Azure subscription can only be associated with one Azure AD tenant. Azure AD to sign in a local computer, the computer also must be in the AD
- Azure Event Hubs: a big data streaming platform and event ingestion service.
- Application Insights is a feature of Azure Monitor that enables users to monitor the performance and usage of their applications. With Application Insights, users can collect a wide range of data about their applications, including performance metrics, log data, and usage data.
- Azure Arc allows organizations to extend the Azure Resource Manager control plane from the public cloud to their on-premises environments so that they can manage these resources like they natively existed in Azure and utilize services like Automanage.
- View the Azure Activity log and send it to Azure Monitor Logs, Azure Event Hubs, and Azure Storage.

## Security Services

- Azure Information Protection (AIP) is a cloud-based solution that enables organizations to discover, classify, and protect documents and emails by applying labels to content.
- Policy: Restrict with virtual machine types can be created in a subscription. You can assign a policy to any scope that you have access to, such as a management group, subscription, or resource group. However, you cannot assign a policy directly to an individual resource. 
- Tags: Identify Azure resources that are associated with specific cost centers
- Blueprints: Deploy a complete Azure Application environment including resources configuration and role assignments.
- Lock: You can assign a lock on every Azure resource that you have access to. You can apply a lock at different levels of scope: subscription, resource group, or individual resource.

## IoT Services

- IoT Sphere = Secure
- IoT Central = Monitor
- IoT Hub - There are two storage services IoT Hub can route messages to -- Azure Blob Storage and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 (ADLS Gen2) accounts.

## CMD, Powershell

- With the Azure Cloud Shell, you can run PowerShell cmdlets and scripts in a Web browser. You log in to the Azure Portal and select the Azure Cloud Shell option.
- Azure CLI and Windows Powershell can be installed on MacOS but it cannot be installed on an iPhone.
- Azure CLI, Azure Portal, Azure Powershell can be installed on Windows, Linux, Mac. with Azure CLI you don't execute Powershell script. `az vm`是cli, `New-AzVM`是powershell

## Others

- Hyper-V hosts are physical servers that run the Hyper-V role in Windows Server. Hyper-V is a hypervisor-based virtualization technology provided by Microsoft, allowing for the creation and management of virtual machines (VMs).
