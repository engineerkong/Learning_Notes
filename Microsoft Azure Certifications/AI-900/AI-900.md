# Examtopics

- ![image](https://github.com/engineerkong/Learning_Notes/assets/89781823/f3521915-3613-4d05-8338-5a798dc6c5d4)

1. Accuracy: (TP + TN) / ALL
2. Precision: TP/(TP+FP)
3. Recall: TP/(TP+FN)
4. F1-SCORE: 2*(P*R)/(P+R)

- Azure Machine Learning designer lets you visually connect **datasets** and **modules** on an interactive canvas to create machine learning models.

- Custom Vision: Object Deteciton has no further types to choose from. / Classification has 2 classification types to choose - MultiClass & MultiLabel.

- Semantic segmentation achieves fine-grained inference by making dense predictions inferring labels for every pixel, so that each pixel is labeled with the class of its enclosing object ore region.

- Face verification: Check the likelihood that two faces belong to the same person and receive a confidence score.

- Transcribe a call to text -Speech Service: Speech to Text Service

Extract call Transcription to find key entity - Text Analytic : Entity Recognition

Translate a call to different langauge : Speech Service : Speech Translations

- speech synthesis 语音合成

- sentiment analysis 情绪分析

- Content types include many standard structured documents such as PDF, DOC, and TXT.

- An intent represents the purpose or goal behind a user's utterance. It captures the user's intention or desired action.

A domain refers to a specific area or topic of knowledge, such as music, sports, or weather.

An entity represents a specific piece of information or data within an utterance. In this case, an entity could be "main stage," which refers to a specific stage at the music festival.

- Active learning.
  
1. Bot gets the answer from the knowledge base.

2.Bot determines explicit feedback.

3.Bot sends selected answer back to QnA Maker with the Train API.

- LUIS determines the intent of a user's text (known as an utterance), while QnA Maker determines the answer to a user's text (known as a query).

- The QnA Maker service, which is a part of Azure Bot Service.

- Variables and Features are input. Labels are the predicted Output.

- Entity types: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/luis/concepts/entities
List entity
Regex entity
Prebuilt entities
Pattern.Any entity
Machine learned (ML) entity

- Power Virtual Agents can be used to build no-code apps that use built-in natural language processing models.
