- Azure Machine Learning designer lets you visually connect **datasets** and **modules** on an interactive canvas to create machine learning models.

- Custom Vision: Object Deteciton has no further types to choose from. / Classification has 2 classification types to choose - MultiClass & MultiLabel.

- Semantic segmentation achieves fine-grained inference by making dense predictions inferring labels for every pixel, so that each pixel is labeled with the class of its enclosing object ore region.

- Face verification: Check the likelihood that two faces belong to the same person and receive a confidence score.

- Transcribe a call to text -Speech Service: Speech to Text Service

Extract call Transcription to find key entity - Text Analytic : Entity Recognition

Translate a call to different langauge : Speech Service : Speech Translations

- speech synthesis 语音合成

- sentiment analysis 情绪分析

- Content types include many standard structured documents such as PDF, DOC, and TXT.

- An intent represents the purpose or goal behind a user's utterance. It captures the user's intention or desired action.

A domain refers to a specific area or topic of knowledge, such as music, sports, or weather.

An entity represents a specific piece of information or data within an utterance. In this case, an entity could be "main stage," which refers to a specific stage at the music festival.

- Active learning.
  
Bot gets the answer from the knowledge base.

2.Bot determines explicit feedback.

3.Bot sends selected answer back to QnA Maker with the Train API.

- LUIS determines the intent of a user's text (known as an utterance), while QnA Maker determines the answer to a user's text (known as a query).

- The QnA Maker service, which is a part of Azure Bot Service.

- Variables and Features are input. Labels are the predicted Output.

- Entity types: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/luis/concepts/entities
List entity
Regex entity
Prebuilt entities
Pattern.Any entity
Machine learned (ML) entity

- Power Virtual Agents can be used to build no-code apps that use built-in natural language processing models.
  
- Inclusiveness: empower everyone to engage people 使每个人都能参与进来

- Accountability: ensure the solution meets ethical and legal standard 问责制 Accountability defines the framework of governance and organizational principles, which are meant to ensure that AI solutions meet ethical and legal standards that are clearly defined.

- When using Azure Machine Learning designer to publish an inference pipeline, which two parameters should you use to consume the pipeline? Each correct answer presents part of the solution: REST Endpoint, Access Key

- inclusive / fairness

- Which three settings do you need to create a compute instance? Name, Size, Type

- NLP: Stemming normalizes words before counting them. Frequency analysis counts how often a word appears in a text. N-grams extend frequency analysis to include multi-term phrases. Vectorization captures semantic relationships between words by assigning them to locations in n-dimensional space.

- When categorizing an image, the Azure AI Vision service supports two specialized domain models: celebrities and landmarks. Image types is an additional capability of the computer vision service, allowing it to detect the type of image, such as a clip art image or a line drawing. Both people_ and people_group are supported categories when performing image classification.

- Tagging involves associating an image with metadata that summarizes the attributes of the image. Detecting image types involves identifying clip art images or line drawings. Content organization involves identifying people or objects in photos and organizing them based on the identification. Categorizing involves associating the contents of an image with a limited set of categories.

- The invoice model extracts key information from sales invoices and is suitable for extracting information from sales account documents. Invoice and Business card model identify and extract common data fields.

- Removing stop words is the first step in the statistical analysis of terms used in a text in the context of NLP. Counting the occurrences of each word takes place after stop words are removed. Creating a vectorized model is not part of statistical analysis. It is used to capture the sematic relationship between words. Encoding words as numeric features is not part of statistical analysis. It is frequently used in sentiment analysis.

- Tokenization is part of speech synthesis that involves breaking text into individual words such that each word can be assigned phonetic sounds. Transcribing is part of speech recognition, which involves converting speech into a text representation. Key phrase extraction is part of language processing, not speech synthesis. Lemmatization, also known as stemming, is part of language processing, not speech synthesis.

- Named entity recognition can identify and categorize entities in unstructured text, such as people, places, organizations, and quantities, and is suitable to support the development of an article recommendation system. Key phrase extraction, Content Moderator, and the PII feature are not suited to entity recognition tasks to build a recommender system.
