# Learning Path
## Get started with Azure AI Services
### Prepare to develop AI solutions on Azure
- Azure Cognitive Search is an Applied AI Service that enables you to ingest and index data from various sources, and search the index to find, filter, and sort information extracted from the source data.
### Create and consume Azure AI services
- Use a REST API: A REST API is a set of rules and conventions for building and interacting with web services. It allows different software applications to communicate with each other over the internet using HTTP requests. (POST, PUT, or GET request)
- Software development kits (SDKs) for common programming languages abstract the REST interfaces for most AI services.
### Secure Azure AI services
- You can regenerate keys using the Azure portal, or using the az cognitiveservices account keys regenerate Azure command-line interface (CLI) command.
- authentication: Key Vault, Token-based authentication, Microsoft Entra ID authentication.
- Network Security: an error that access is denied due to Virtual Network/Firewall rules - in Networking properties, add your client IP address to the Firewall allowed list.
### Monitor Azure AI services
- Cost (Cost management), Alerts (Alerts in resource), Metrics (Metrics in resource, Dashboard Hub), Diagnostic logging (Diagnostic settings in resource, Azure Log Anlaytics)

- Container Images from Registry
