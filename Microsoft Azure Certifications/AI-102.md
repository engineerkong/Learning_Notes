# Learning Path
## Get started with Azure AI Services
### Prepare to develop AI solutions on Azure
- Azure Cognitive Search is an Applied AI Service that enables you to ingest and index data from various sources, and search the index to find, filter, and sort information extracted from the source data.
### Create and consume Azure AI services
- Use a REST API: A REST API is a set of rules and conventions for building and interacting with web services. It allows different software applications to communicate with each other over the internet using HTTP requests. (POST, PUT, or GET request)
- Software development kits (SDKs) for common programming languages abstract the REST interfaces for most AI services.
### Secure Azure AI services
- You can regenerate keys using the Azure portal, or using the az cognitiveservices account keys regenerate Azure command-line interface (CLI) command.
- authentication: Key Vault, Token-based authentication, Microsoft Entra ID authentication.
- Network Security: an error that access is denied due to Virtual Network/Firewall rules - in Networking properties, add your client IP address to the Firewall allowed list.
### Monitor Azure AI services
- Cost (Cost management), Alerts (Alerts in resource), Metrics (Metrics in resource, Dashboard Hub), Diagnostic logging (Diagnostic settings in resource, Azure Log Anlaytics)

- Container Images from Registry
- Object Detection in Cusom Vision:
Tags: "apple"
Left: 0.1
Top: 0.5
Width: 0.5
Height: 0.25
- The Azure AI Vision service enables you to detect people in an image, as well as returning a bounding box for its location.
- The Face service offers more comprehensive facial analysis capabilities than the Azure AI Vision service, including: Face detection (with bounding box). Comprehensive facial feature analysis (including head pose, presence of spectacles, blur, facial landmarks, occlusion and others). Face comparison and verification. Facial recognition.
- The Azure AI Vision service offers two APIs that you can use to read text. The Read API. The Image Anlysis API. The results of from the Read API are broken down by page, then line, and then word.
- The Azure Video Indexer service is designed to help you extract information from videos. Facial recognition, Optical character recognition, Speech transcription, Topics, Sentiment, Labels, Content moderation, Scene segmentation. Azure Video Indexer includes predefined models that can recognize well-known celebrities, do OCR, and transcribe spoken phrases into text. You can extend the recognition capabilities of Video Analyzer by creating custom models for: People, Language, Brands. Using Azure Video Indexer widgets and Azure Video Indexer API.
- Azure AI Language is designed to help you extract information from text. It provides functionality that you can use for: Language Detection, Key Phrase extration, sentiment analysis, Named entity recognition, Entity linking.
- The knowledge base can be created from existing sources, including: Web sites containing frequently asked question (FAQ) documentation. Files containing structured text, such as brochures or user guides. Built-in chit chat question and answer pairs that encapsulate common conversational exchanges.
- Language understanding: Service uses natural language understanding to interpret the utterance, match it to an intent, and identify entities. Response indicates the most likely intent and referenced entities.
- This kind of interaction is referred to as a multi-turn conversation.
- People often ask questions that are phrased differently, but ultimately have the same meaning. Active learning can help in situations like this because it enables you to consider alternate questions to each question and answer pair. Active learning is enabled by default. Active learning then begins to offer alternate questions for each question in your question and answer pairs. 
- a natural language understanding solution:
1. An app accepts natural language input from a user.
2. A language model is used to determine semantic meaning (the user's intent).
3. The app performs an appropriate action.
- Azure AI Language service features fall into two categories: Pre-configured features, and Learned features.
- Personally identifiable information (PII) detection: allows you to identify, categorize, and redact information that could be considered sensitive.
- CLU helps users to build custom natural language understanding models to predict overall intent and extract important information from incoming utterances.
- Utterances are the phrases that a user might enter when interacting with an application that uses your language model. An intent represents a task or action the user wants to perform, or more simply the meaning of an utterance. You create a model by defining intents and associating them with one or more utterances.
- The precision, consistency and completeness of your labeled data are key factors to determining model performance. Entities are used to add specific context to intents. For example, you might define a TurnOnDevice intent that can be applied to multiple devices, and use entities to define the different devices. 1. Learned 2. List 3. Prebuilt "Turn off the {DeviceName}" Train_Test_Deploy_Review
- Custom text classification: Single label classification, Multiple label classification
