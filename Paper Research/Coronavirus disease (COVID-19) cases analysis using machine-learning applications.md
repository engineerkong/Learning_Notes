The paper titled "Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) cases analysis using machine-learning applications" discusses several key points and new technologies in machine learning (ML) related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Here are some of the highlights:

1. **Overview of Machine Learning (ML) in Health Care**: The paper emphasizes the crucial role of artificial intelligence (AI) and ML in healthcare, especially in diagnosing COVID-19. It mentions the use of AI and deep learning algorithms for precise diagnosis, supporting common diagnostic methods like chest x-ray, CT scan, RT-PCR, and immunochromatographic fluorescence assay.

2. **Types of Machine Learning Applied**: The paper discusses the various paradigms within ML, such as Supervised Learning (SL), Unsupervised Learning (UL), and Reinforcement Learning (RL). SL is used on labeled datasets and is suitable for tasks involving a known ground-truth output. In contrast, UL deals with unlabeled data, aiming to find patterns, while RL is used for sequential decision-making tasks.

3. **ML in Predicting COVID-19 Cases and Mortality**: ML methods are utilized for predicting confirmed cases and mortality rates. The paper divides ML applications into two parts: first, optimizing data fusion and eliminating unusable nodes using genetic algorithms; second, identifying fault nodes through fault recognition neural networks.

4. **ML Types and Tasks in Research**: The paper notes that supervised learning is dominant in machine-learning applications, with a majority of studies using this method. It also highlights that classification is the main task addressed in ML research, followed by regression and clustering.

5. **Machine Learning Algorithms Used**: The paper identifies several ML algorithms used in research, with logistic regression being the most frequent. Other algorithms include Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Linear Regression, K-Means, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Naive Bayes.

6. **Innovative Applications of ML**: The paper discusses innovative uses of ML in COVID-19 research, like drone-based thermal screening for infection identification without human intervention. This represents a significant advancement in remote and automated diagnostic methods.

7. **Challenges in Machine Learning for COVID-19**: The paper acknowledges challenges in applying ML techniques, such as the selection of appropriate parameters for training models and the choice of the most suitable ML model for predictions, especially given the limitations of the available datasets.

This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the application of various machine-learning methods and technologies in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, highlighting both the advancements and challenges in this field.
