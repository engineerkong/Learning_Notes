The paper "Machine Learning-Guided Protein Engineering" provides a comprehensive overview of the application of machine learning (ML) in protein engineering. Key points and new technologies discussed in the paper include:

1. **Increasing Integration of ML in Protein Engineering**: The paper notes a growing trend in the use of machine learning in protein engineering literature. This reflects the recognition of ML as a generally applicable and useful technology in this field【2†source】.

2. **Basics and Applications of ML in Protein Engineering**: The document reviews the fundamental aspects of machine learning and its specific application to protein data. It also comprehensively covers recent progress in the field, illustrating how machine learning methods have been applied in creating new enzyme designs for laboratory and practical applications【2†source】.

3. **Gaps in Current ML Approaches for Protein Engineering**: Despite promising applications and case studies, significant knowledge gaps remain. These include the need to apply ML to a broader range of protein engineering tasks, such as predicting the effects of insertions/deletions and unnatural amino acids, creating predictors for multiple targets, and predicting mutational effects on protein interactions. Additionally, molecular dynamics is still isolated from major ML advancements in protein engineering, with dynamical information rarely used in training current predictors【49†source】.

4. **Need for Accessible ML Tools**: While deep learning tools are becoming more accessible and easier to use, the paper highlights the importance of simpler ML methods to advance traditional protein engineering pipelines, especially for groups without deep learning expertise or infrastructure【49†source】.

5. **Trust and Reporting Standards**: The authors stress the importance of trust in ML predictions and the need for fair assessment of tools. They encourage openness about limitations and additional steps used in published case studies, such as manual fine-tuning. Efforts are underway to improve reporting standards for ML tools in biology, and clear guidelines have been proposed for manuscripts dealing with ML【62†source】.

6. **Future Opportunities**: The paper suggests looking to other disciplines for inspiration to elevate ML-based enzyme design and emphasizes the need to engage the broader community of biochemists and synthetic biologists【49†source】.

These key points underscore the potential of machine learning in revolutionizing protein engineering, while also identifying areas where further development and integration are needed.
