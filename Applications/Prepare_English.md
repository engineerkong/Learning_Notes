## Master's Thesis
- Keywords: robot tasks, reinforcement learning algos and hps, sim2real transfer, landscape visualization.
- Details:
1. Define three robot tasks: reach, push, pnp. Select two algorithms: SAC and PPO. Select two hyperparameters: learning rate and discount factor. 
2. Find and tailor the simulation environment to the real robot environment.
3. Do the trial training of one combination of algos and hps on the simulation to find the suitable reward function and the total time consumption.
4. Train many combinations for each robot task on the simulation over a cloud-server.
5. Implement the trained models on the real robot environment and compare between the performance on simulation and real.
6. Evaluate the results and build a landscape visualization to show the effect of algos and hps on Sim2Real Transfer.
